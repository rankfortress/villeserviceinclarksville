	These come from water leaking through the roof. Do not assume a small stain means that the leak is small. It could be that the water has traveled some distance before making the stain, so assuming that the problem is not big could end up damaging your roof more. That means you will probably have to pay a lot more to get the repairs done. Call us immediately you suspect that there is a leak so that we can do an inspection.
